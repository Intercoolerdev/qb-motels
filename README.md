### Installation

1. Download "qb-motels" from my github page (I guess you've already done that, lol)
2. Delete "qb-apartments" from your resources folder
3. Open "qb-motels-main". In there you'll find "qb-motels".
4. Drag and drop it into your "resources" folder. If your new, i would recommend dropping it into your [qb] folder.
5. If you drop it anywhere outside of your [qb] folder. Then go to your server.cfg. And type in "ensure qb-houses"
6. And give me feedbacks about the script ;)
